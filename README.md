## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

To use the CSS "vendor prefixex" in order to access the controls properties.

### Continued development

I'm not very happy with the way I resolved the " 185 GB left" dialog bubble implementation. I guess there's a better way to solve it (hope I'll learn it in other solutions). 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/html5-progress-element/) - This helped using the CSS "vendor prefixes" for the progress bar.
